TAI (Transponder Abstraction Interface)
=======================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ishidawataru/OOPT-DTC-TAI.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ishidawataru/OOPT-DTC-TAI/builds)

The Transponder Abstraction Interface, or TAI, defines the API to provide a
vendor-independent way of controlling transponders from various vendors and 
implementations in a uniform manner. It is based upon and quite common to the
Switch Abstraction Interface, or SAI.

Components
-----------

TAI is an interface specification implemented as a collection of C-language 
header files. TAI adopts the use of many terms from SAI, including "Adapter" and 
"Adapter Host".

An Adapter is similar to a user mode driver. It translates the hardware 
independent TAI interface to a specific hardware implementation. This is 
implemented as a shared library, and will typically be provided by the 
transponder module vendor. This shared library is called libtai.so.

An Adapter Host is hardware independent software which uses the TAI interface
to provide optical transponder functionality to other parts of the system. An 
adapter host loads the shared library adapter.

The TAI Interface
-----------------

The adapter host begins using TAI by invoking the `tai_api_initialize()` 
function. This function allows the adapter to initialize various data structures 
for subsequent use. It does **not** initialize the underlying hardware. There 
are two parameters passed to the `tai_api_initialize()` function: `flags`, which 
is currently unused and must be set to zero, and `services`.

`services` is a pointer to a structure of function pointers. This structure 
provides the adapter with function entry points (services) in the adapter host 
which the adapter can call. There is currently only one member in the structure, 
`module_presence`, which the adapter calls whenever there is a change in the 
presence or absence of modules in the system. As a matter of fact, the adapter 
will typically call the `module_presence()` function for each module in the 
system, perhaps even before returning from the `tai_api_initialize()` function. 
The `module_presence()` function may be called from a different thread than the 
main adapter host thread. And since TAI functions are not thread-safe, the 
adapter host is required make sure that it does not re-enter the TAI interface 
from the `module_presence()` function. This can be done by, for example, 
enqueueing the notifications for later processing on the main adapter 
host thread.

The `tai_api_uninitialize()` function is the inverse function to 
`tai_api_initialize()` and is called when the adapter host has completed all TAI 
interface processing. For example, just before exiting. This function will undo 
what was done in `tai_api_initialize()`, freeing memory, closing files, stopping 
threads, etc, in order to gracefully wrap up execution of the adapter.

After `tai_api_initialize()` returns successfully, the adapter host is free to 
call the other TAI APIs. It does this by first obtaining a list of function 
entry points for each API. There are currently three APIs:

* Module
* Network Interface
* Host Interface

For each of these APIs, a list of function entry pointers is obtained by calling 
the `tai_api_query()` function. This function takes two parameters, 
`tai_api_id`, which identifies which of the three API's function pointers are 
being requested, and `api_method_table`, the address of a pointer which the 
adapter will set to point to the method table for that API.

A method table contains function entry pointers to the functions which 
implement the API. Currently, all three APIs have very similar method tables 
which contain six functions:

* Create an object
* Destroy an object
* Set the value of an attribute of an object
* Set the values for a list of attributes of an object
* Get the value of an attribute of an object
* Get the values for a list of attributes of an object

### TAI Objects

Each API allows objects to be created through the `create_xxx()` method table 
function. This function creates an instance of the object and initializes 
its attributes. When an object is no longer needed the adapter host can call
the `remove_xxx()` method table function, which will remove that object and its 
attributes. The `set_xxx_attribute()` function can be called once an object has 
been created to modify the value of one of the object's attributes. The 
`get_xxx_attribute()` function is used to retrieve the value of an object's 
attribute. The `set_xxx_attributes()` and `get_xxx_attributes()` functions
(notice the 's' at the end of the function names) are provided for convenience 
to set and get a list of attributes in a single function call.

#### Module Objects

The module API allows module objects to be created. A module object represents 
an optical module. Calling the `create_module()` function causes the optical 
module to be initialized, which typically involves resetting the module and 
bringing it into a default state. This function must be called prior to creating 
host interface or network interface objects on a module. The `create_module()` 
function takes four parameters:

* A pointer to a tai_object_id_t. The adapter will return a pointer to the newly 
allocated module ID object. The adapter host should treat this object as opaque. 
It will be used in subsequent TAI function calls.
* attr_count and attr_list. A list of attributes which will be set upon the 
module object when it is created. This can be used to override the default 
attribute values for a module.
* notification functions. A pointer to a list of function pointers in the 
adapter host which the adapter can call to notify the adapter host of changes in 
status of the module.

The attr_list supplied on the `create_module()` function call must contain a 
`TAI_MODULE_ATTR_LOCATION` attribute. This attribute defines which module is 
being created. This is typically set to the value of the module_location 
parameter from the `module_presence()` function.

An adapter host will typically call `create_module()` once for each module 
present in the system, as indicated when the adapter calls the 
`module_presence()` function.

Once the adapter host no longer needs to access the module it should call the 
`remove_module()` function. This can occur as the result of the 
`module_presence()` function being called indicating the module was removed, or 
when the adapter host is exiting, or whenever the adapter host feel like it. 
Removing the module simply makes it unaccessible to the adapter host. The actual 
state of the module is undefined. The adapter may put the module in reset, or 
may just leave the module in the same state it was prior to the 
`remove_module()` call. After calling `remove_module()` the object ID for the 
module which was returned in the `create_module()` function is invalid and 
should not be used in any subsequent TAI API calls.

Once the `create_module()` function returns with an object ID for a module, the 
adapter host can use this object ID to get and set attributes of the module with 
the `get_module_attribute()`, `get_module_attributes()`, 
`set_module_attribute()`, and `set_module_attributes()` function calls. Most of 
the module attributes are read-only and cannot be modified with the 
`set_module_attribute()` and `set_module_attributes()` functions.

Host interface objects and network interfaces objects are associated with the 
module on which they exist. This association is made when a host interface or 
network interface object is created, since the object ID of the associated 
module is a parameter of those `create_host_interface()` and 
`create_network_interface()` function calls. Because of this association, host 
interface and network interface objects should be removed by calling 
`remove_host_interface()` or `remove_network_interface()` prior to removing the 
module with which they are associated.

One of the attributes of a module object is the number of host interface and 
another attribute is the number of network interfaces. These values can be used 
when determining how many host interface objects and network interface objects 
exist on the module, and the index values used when calling 
`create_host_interface()` and `create_network_interface()`.

#### Host Interface Objects

The host interface API allows host interface objects to be created. A host 
interface object represents an interface between an optical module and the 
host system, sometimes called client interfaces. Creating a host interface 
object allows the attributes of that interface to be set and retrieved. The 
`create_host_interface()` function takes four parameters:

* A pointer to a tai_object_id_t. The adapter will return a pointer to the newly 
allocated host interface ID object. The adapter host should treat this object as 
opaque. It will be used in subsequent TAI function calls. 
* The module ID. Identifies the module ID upon which the host interface exists.  
This object ID was returned when the module was created.
* attr_count and attr_list. A list of attributes which will be set upon the 
host interface object when it is created. This can be used to override the 
default attribute values for a host interface.

The attr_list must contain an `TAI_HOST_INTERFACE_ATTR_INDEX` attribute. This 
attribute defines which host interface is being created. This is a zero-based 
index of the host interfaces on a module.

An adapter host will typically call `create_host_interface()` once for each 
host interface present in the module, as indicated by the number of host 
interfaces, which is a module object attribute.

Once the adapter host no longer needs to access the host interface it should 
call the `remove_host_interface()` function. This can occur as the result of the 
`module_presence()` function being called indicating the module was removed, or 
when the adapter host is exiting, or whenever the adapter host feel like it. 
Removing the host interface simply makes it unaccessible to the adapter host. 
The actual state of the host interface is undefined. The adapter may put the  
host interface in reset, or may just leave the host interface in the same state 
it was prior to the `remove_host_interface()` call. After calling 
`remove_host_interface()` the object ID for the host interface which was 
returned in the `create_host_interface()` function is invalid and should not be 
used in any subsequent TAI API calls.

Once the `create_host_interface()` function returns with an object ID for a 
host interface, the adapter host can use this object ID to get and set 
attributes of the module with the `get_host_interface_attribute()`, 
`get_host_interface_attributes()`, `set_host_interface_attribute()`, and 
`set_host_interface_attributes()` function calls.

#### Network Interface Objects

The network interface API allows network interface objects to be created. A 
network interface object represents an interface between the optical module and 
the optical line system. Creating a network interface object allows the 
attributes of that interface to be set and retrieved. The
`create_network_interface()` function takes four parameters:

* A pointer to a tai_object_id_t. The adapter will return a pointer to the newly 
allocated network interface ID object. The adapter host should treat this object 
as opaque. It will be used in subsequent TAI function calls. 
* The module ID. Identifies the module ID upon which the network interface 
exists. This object ID was returned when the module was created.
* attr_count and attr_list. A list of attributes which will be set upon the 
network interface object when it is created. This can be used to override the 
default attribute values for a network interface.

The attr_list must contain an `TAI_NETWORK_INTERFACE_ATTR_INDEX` attribute. This 
attribute defines which network interface is being created. This is a zero-based 
index of the network interfaces on a module.

An adapter host will typically call `create_network_interface()` once for each 
network interface present in the module, as indicated by the number of network 
interfaces, which is a module object attribute.

Once the adapter host no longer needs to access the network interface it should 
call the `remove_network_interface()` function. This can occur as the result of
the `module_presence()` function being called indicating the module was removed, 
or when the adapter host is exiting, or whenever the adapter host feel like it. 
Removing the network interface simply makes it unaccessible to the adapter host. 
The actual state of the network interface is undefined. The adapter may put the  
network interface in reset, or may just leave the network interface in the same
state it was prior to the `remove_network_interface()` call. After calling 
`remove_network_interface()` the object ID for the network interface which was 
returned in the `create_network_interface()` function is invalid and should not
be used in any subsequent TAI API calls.

Once the `create_network_interface()` function returns with an object ID for a 
network interface, the adapter host can use this object ID to get and set 
attributes of the module with the `get_network_interface_attribute()`, 
`get_network_interface_attributes()`, `set_network_interface_attribute()`, and 
`set_network_interface_attributes()` function calls.

TAI Attributes
--------------

Each object has a list of attributes which are specific to that type of object. 
Each attribute is assigned an ID which is used to get or set the attribute's 
value. The TAI header files for each API list the attributes for each object, 
including descriptions of the format and access types. For example, the 
taimodule.h header file lists the module object attributes. The 
`TAI_MODULE_ATTR_MAX_LASER_FREQ` attribute, for example, has a short description 
(The TX/RX maximum laster frequency in Hz), the data type (tai_uint64_t), and 
the access rules (READ_ONLY). Unless otherwise stated, attributes can be set and
retrieved at any time after the object is created and prior to its destruction. 
Modifying an attribute will commonly cause a modification in the operational 
state of a module. Refer to the taimodule.h, taihostif.h and tainetworkif.h 
files for a list of the attributes of each object type.

TAI Return Codes
----------------

Every TAI API function returns one of the codes in the taistatus.h file. 
Successful execution of the function is indicated by the TAI_STATUS_SUCCESS 
code. A failure is indicated by any value other than TAI_STATUS_SUCCESS.

When processing a list of attributes, the return code can indicate not just 
that a failure occurred, but also which attribute in the list caused that 
failure. The return codes TAI_STATUS_INVALID_ATTRIBUTE_0, 
TAI_STATUS_INVALID_ATTR_VALUE_0, TAI_STATUS_ATTR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED_0,
TAI_STATUS_UNKNOWN_ATTRIBUTE_0, and TAI_STATUS_ATTR_NOT_SUPPORTED_0 are spaced 
out by 64K. Therefore, the least significant 16 bits of each of those error 
codes contains the index into the attribute list of the attribute which caused 
the error.
